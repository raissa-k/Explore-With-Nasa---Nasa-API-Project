# Explore with Nasa - an API Project
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5f28411d-7f72-46ae-815f-08eeb658ceb6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/explore-with-nasa/deploys)


[See website](https://explore-with-nasa.netlify.app/)

## About
A simple website, with JavaScript used to retrieve [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) from today's entry and from the archive.

The media type information - image or video - is extracted from json to correctly write the appropriate img or iframe tag, so the user will not be limited to images.

## Next steps?
- Change the date picker to a drop-down menu for better accessibility
- Implement a search future for retrieval of relevant archive files
